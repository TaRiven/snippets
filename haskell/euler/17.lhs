If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five,
then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written
out in words, how many letters would be used?


NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred
and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen)
contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in
compliance with British usage.

First, we're going to need some words to name these things.

> ones =  ["", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine"]
> teens = ["ten", "eleven", "twelve", "thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen", "sixteen",
>          "seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen"]
> tens =  ["", "", "twenty", "thirty", "forty", "fifty", "sixty", "seventy", "eighty", "ninety"]


> numwords n
>   | n < 10 = ones !! n
>   | n < 20 = teens !! (n `mod` 10)
>   | n < 100 = let (t,o) = n `divMod` 10 in (tens !! t) ++ " " ++ (numwords o)
>   | n < 1000 = let (h,t) = n `divMod` 100 in
>                 (ones !! h) ++ if t == 0 then " hundred" else " hundred and " ++ (numwords t)
>   | n < 1000000 = let (t,h) = n `divMod` 1000 in (numwords t) ++ " thousand " ++ (numwords h)

Need a thing to count all the letters in this junk.
