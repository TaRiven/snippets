This isn't quite where I want it yet even for what it does.  I have
decided against the X11 and SVGALIB binary because I don't like SVGALIB
that much.  I'm going to spend more time trying to make the X11 version
where I want it, if I can find out where that is anyway.

I kind of got the aspect ratio to do something that looks like it's
working properly.  That's a start.  Now there's a bug in the zoom-in
thingy.  Gotta work on that...
