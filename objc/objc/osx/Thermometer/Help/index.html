		<h1>Using Thermometer</h1>

		<p>
			For the most part, this app can be used without modification.
			However, if you would like it to display your own thermometers, you
			can do this by providing a URL that provides temperatures.
		</p>

		<p>
			By default, the app displays temperatures at my house via the
			following URL:

			<blockquote>
				<code>http://bleu.west.spy.net/therm/Temperature</code>
			</blockquote>

			This URL is expected to provided a textual list of results where each
			line is the name of a thermometer.  For example, consider the
			following output from mine:

<pre>bedroom
garage
livingroom
guestroom
newmachineroom
backyard
			</pre>

			That creates six individual cells for the display.  Each cell is
			queried via the following URL:

			<blockquote>
				<code>http://bleu.west.spy.net/therm/Temperature?temp=<i>name</i></code>
			</blockquote>

			Where <i>name</i> is replaced with the name of the thermometer.  This
			URL is expected to return the current reading of the given
			thermometer in celsius.  For example:

			<code>16.86</code>
		</p>

		<h2>The Display</h2>
		<p>

			Each thermometer contains two basic data elements:

			<ul>
				<li>The current reading (below the center)</li>
				<li>The trend (above the center)</li>
			</ul>

			The current reading is the reading as of the last update (seen at the
			bottom of the window).  The trend is the difference between the
			current reading and the reading ten samples ago.

			</p>
			<p>
			For example, if your sample rate is 300 (once every five minutes),
			and your current reading is 35.81, and the trend is -0.21, then the
			temperature has fallen .21 degrees in the last 50 minutes.
