		<h1>Using Thermometer</h1>

		<p>
			For the most part, this app can be used without modification.
			However, if you would like it to display your own thermometers, you
			can do this by providing a URL that provides temperatures.
		</p>

		<p>
			By default, the app displays temperatures at my house via the
			following URL:

			<blockquote>
				<code>http://bleu.west.spy.net/therm/Temperature</code>
			</blockquote>

			This URL is expected to provided a textual list of results where each
			line is the name of a thermometer.  For example, consider the
			following output from mine:

<pre>bedroom
garage
livingroom
guestroom
newmachineroom
backyard
			</pre>

			That creates six individual cells for the display.  Each cell is
			queried via the following URL:

			<blockquote>
				<code>http://bleu.west.spy.net/therm/Temperature?temp=<i>name</i></code>
			</blockquote>

			Where <i>name</i> is replaced with the name of the thermometer.  This
			URL is expected to return the current reading of the given
			thermometer in celsius.  For example:

			<code>16.86</code>
